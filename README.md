# heart_attack_predictor
The project is about predicting heart attack based on several variables using machine learning algorithms. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset), and some examples and insights were taken from other Kaggle notebooks (https://www.kaggle.com/code/namanmanchanda/heart-attack-eda-prediction-90-accuracy). Various algorithms were implemented and evaluated, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests. The best performing algorithms were found to be decision trees and random forests, achieving an accuracy of over 80%. Hyperparameter tuning was performed for both models to improve their performance. Overall, the project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for predicting heart attacks, which can have important implications for healthcare and disease prevention.
